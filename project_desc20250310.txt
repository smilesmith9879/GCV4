AI Smart Four-Wheel Drive Car Comprehensive Solution
March 9, 2025 | Final Version

1. Project Overview
This project is based on Raspberry Pi 5, integrating a high-precision camera, four-wheel-drive chassis, brushless motors with PID speed control, visual SLAM, voice interaction, and web remote control, creating an AI-powered car that supports intelligent navigation and real-time interaction.

Core Features
✅ Web Control: Remote control via WebSocket + Flask API, supporting virtual joysticks for car and camera gimbal operation.
✅ Real-time Video Transmission: Uses WebRTC + HUANER wide-angle camera for low-latency HD video streaming.
✅ Voice Interaction: Integrated with Whisper + Ollama + DeepSeekR1 1.5B for local voice recognition and intelligent responses.
✅ Four-Motor Control: Utilizes the LOBOROBOT function library for precise car movement control.
✅ AI Autonomous Navigation: Uses a monocular camera with ORB-SLAM 3 for real-time environment mapping and path planning.
✅ Text-to-Speech (TTS): The car can read out DeepSeekR1’s responses, supporting Chinese and English, with adjustable volume and speed.
✅ Integration with ROS 2 + MPU6050: Enables autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.

3. Software System
Operating System: Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
Core Control Program: LOBOROBOT.py (controls car movement)
Text-to-Speech (TTS): Edge-TTS
4. Web Control Interface Design
📌 Optimized UI Interaction
Dual Joystick Layout (Mobile Landscape Mode)

Left Joystick: Controls car movement (forward, backward, left, right).
Right Joystick: Controls camera gimbal rotation (up, down, left, right).
Joystick Auto-Centering: Returns to the center when released and sends a stop command.
Adaptive Turning Speed: Automatically reduces speed to 50% when turning left or right.
Full-Screen Adaptation: Automatically adjusts size for optimal display.
Enhanced HUD Design: Overlays speed, direction, and camera angle information.

📌 Bottom Interaction Area
🎤 Voice Button (Safari Optimization)

Long press to activate voice recognition for controlling the car or camera.
Compatible with Google Chrome & Apple Safari, fixes permission issues.
📜 Text Input Box (Ancient Scroll Style)

Supports direct command input for AI interaction (e.g., "Move forward for 3 seconds").
🔊 Voice Playback

DeepSeekR1 responses are automatically read aloud.
Adjustable volume & speed, supports Chinese and English.
5. Thematic Style
📌 Visual Aesthetics
Color Scheme: Mystical blue, bronze, and gold, incorporating ancient rune elements.
Button Design: Ancient rune-style buttons with soft glowing animations.
Background Texture: Low-contrast temple murals to enhance UI depth.
6. Key Optimizations
✅ Remote Control & Safari Compatibility
New settings button: Allows users to manually request permissions.
HTTPS detection: Disables voice control when not using HTTPS and displays an error message.
✅ AI Startup Voice Prompt
When DeepSeekR1 initializes, it automatically announces:
“Hello, I am ready.”
Displays the message in the chat box to inform users that AI is available.
This final version ensures smooth navigation, real-time interaction, and an immersi
